Link to Calculator(also my test for Apache Dir):
http://ec2-50-16-177-186.compute-1.amazonaws.com/~roberto/module2/calculator.html
To use the calculator enter 1 number(can be any number within the range of a floating point) in the first free text spot and then do the same for the second free
text spot. After this click one operation then calculate and it will appear on a new page. It never said how to display floating point numbers so I just rounded
my numbers to 2 decimal places but it should work for all floating point numbers.
