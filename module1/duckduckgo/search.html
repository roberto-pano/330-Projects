            Regrade Policy:
            It must be objectively clear that an error was made during grading. 
            Examples of such errors include a grader incorrectly summing points or incorrectly 
            marking something not completed. Grades based on the judgement of the grader, except in 
            extremely extenuating circumstances, will not be regraded. In particular, grades for categories 
            like "Site is Visually Appealing" will not be regraded. All regrade requests must be submitted by 
            email to cse330ta@gmail.com within one week of grading. Requests submitted after this deadline will
            not be considered. Requests must contain a specific explanation of the error, including 
            filenames and line numbers of code, if appropriate.
