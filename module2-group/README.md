Link to Login Page:

Acceptable usernames from the start: rob, gill

In rob: test.txt 
This is a file already uploaded if you want to use this as a start point.

To view and delete files you must enter the name of the acceptable files from the list given at the bottom of the page. If an invalid filename
it will just redirect back to the page.




CREATIVE PORTION:

If you enter an invalid user it will bring you back to the login page, but the second time using the login page with the same user
it will allow you to login. This is done as a way to mimic creating new accounts 


We also have implemented a share feature where you can enter another valid user and a valid filename that is in the current user's directory and then 
share it to another user. First you would enter a valid filename in the first free text area and then a valid username in the user text area.

For purposes of ease you can share a file from rob to gill that is not test.txt because that is currently in both.


All good: 55/55
